		<h1 id="introducing-scalejs">Introducing Scalejs</h1>
<p>Scalejs offers many unique features to aid in the development of Singe Page JavaScript Apps which run within a .NET enviroment.
With Scalejs you will not only get a robust JavaScript framework for building versatile web and mobile applications, but also the benefits of the Visual Studio IDE.</p>
<h2 id="extendable">Extendable</h2>
<p>Extensibility is essential for building maintainble and scalable applications. 
The scalejs core is small and is designed to be extended to provide the features your application needs.
Extensions are designed to create a consistent API your applications can use, regardless of whatever
base JavaScript libraries you use. They can be installed and updated via NuGet which allows you to focus
less on maintaining and updating old code, and more on writing new code.</p>
<h2 id="build-large-applications">Build Large Applications</h2>
<p>Scalejs is designed for building large and robust applications. It allows you to create modular applications
which allows you to develop in an organized manner while also giving you the ability to 
develop loosely-coupled features independently. As your applications grow larger, you will need to write
tests and scalejs lets you do that too.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-integration">Visual Studio Integration</h2>
<p>Scalejs stands out from other JavaScript frameworks by providing full access to the features in Visual Studio througout
the development lifecycle. Scalejs comes with Visual Studio templates to get you started with your development. 
You can manage packages with NuGet easily, and also develop your own. Building and Running your project
is a breeze and does the work of starting up a web server and creating deployable packages for you. 
Intellisense, a much beloved and useful feature, is provided for the entire scalejs API as well as code you write yourself.
Not to mention that if your application relies on a .NET backend, you do not need to maintain seperate development
enviroments and your team can code in one place.</p>
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>
<p>Scalejs is optimized to run anywhere. When you build your application, you will wind up with seperate packages for
Web, Android, IPad, and Windows 8. These will allow your web applications to have a native mobile feel to them;
the user won&#39;t even know they&#39;re actually running an application created by HTML5 and JavaScript. Code once, deploy
anywhere will allow your team to be more productive and efficient. </p>
<h2 id="extensive">Extensive</h2>
<p>Scalejs core will allow you to add extensions as needed, and everything you need is already there for you to use.
Most applications will make use of the MVVM pattern, state management, layout, and routing, so we&#39;ve already created
these extensions. We also have developed various UI components such as grids.</p>
