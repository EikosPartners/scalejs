<h1 id="todo-mvc-application">ToDo MVC Application</h1>
<p>We will demonstrate how to create a Scalejs application by creating a ToDo MVC app. Scalejs is better suited for creating large and scalable applications, but we will cover some basics with the ToDo MVC app such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition of Modules</li>
<li>View, View Models, and Bindings</li>
<li>States and Routing</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the Project
Creating a new Scalejs project is simple. Once you <a href="./install.html">Install Scalejs</a>, 
you can create a Scalejs project by simply selecting the template for a 
<strong>Scalejs MVVM Application (CSS)</strong> from the project creation template.</p>
<p>For this tutorial we will use the CSS template. LESS will be covered in another tutorial. </p>
<p><img src="./project1.png" alt="Scalejs MVVM Application is listed under &#39;Visual C#&#39; templates"></p>
<p>Every Scalejs Project template has a basic file structure. 
See <a href="./overview.html">Explaination and Overview</a>  for more details.<br>Your application code, which we will be editting in this tutorial, is within the �app� folder. 
This folder contains the <a href="./overview.html#modules">modules</a> for your project. 
A module will contain <a href="./bindings.html">bindings</a>, <a href="./overview.html#viewmodels">viewmodels</a>,
<a href="./overview.html#styles">styles</a> and <a href="./overview.html#views">views</a> for your project. </p>
<p><img src="./project2.png" alt="Files generated by project template"></p>
<p>To view and run the project, simply press <strong>ctrl + f5</strong>. Then open a browser with a <a href="./best.html#debug">debugging console</a>
and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a> to see it in action!</p>
<p><img src="./helloworld.png" alt="Hello World!"></p>
<p><em>Scalejs MVVM Application template is a working Hello World! Sample. <a href="./hello.html">See how Hello World works!</a></em></p>
<h2 id="designing-our-application-architecture">Designing our Application Architecture</h2>
<p>The best thing about the ToDo MVC application is that we already know the specification and the design. 
How will our Scalejs app accomplish these things? Before we go into the code, 
we will have a quick overview of how we will modularize the code so that you will have exposure 
to creating multiple modules.</p>
<p><img src="./todo.png" alt="ToDo App consists of two modules: main and todo"></p>
<p>Conceptually, we could make the �todo� module as part of the �main� module, 
but usually scalejs apps consist of a main or base module which will be a container for other modules. 
This allows for the creation of multiple modules which will be separated from each other, 
and the main module controls navigation and the <a href="./overview.html#layout">layout</a>. 
Unfortunately �todoMVC� is a very simple app, so I could not split this up into more conceptual modules. 
You can take a look at our other <a href="./samples.html">samples</a> to see what a more complex app might look like.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-todo-module">Creating the todo Module</h2>
<p>To make a module is extremely easy with scalejs. 
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the app folder and select <strong>Add &gt; New Item.</strong>
From the Add New Item window, search for <em>scalejs</em> and select the 
<strong>Scalejs MVVM Module (CSS)</strong>. Name this module <em>todo</em> and click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="./module1.png" alt="Creating a new Module"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">require([
    <span class="string">'scalejs!application/main,todo'</span>
], <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(
    application
)</span> {</span>
    <span class="string">'use strict'</span>;

    application.run();
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-the-views">Creating the Views</h2>
<p>The next step in this process will be to create the views* as we have been already given a template to work with. In order to create the view, we need to section off the template we were given into two parts: main and todo. The views are html files which contain templates for the view and they are in the views folder for each module.
For our main view, we need to do two things: add the html pertinent to the main module AND reference the todo module within this html. All html within the �todo� module belongs in the views folder for the �todo� module so it must be separated from the rest of the html. This is what we get for the main_template after extracting the html from the template we were given, and removing the html for the todo module.</p>
